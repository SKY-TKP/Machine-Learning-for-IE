# 📈 Statistical Inference and Modeling

**2102-575 | STAT INFER MODEL**
*(Department of Electrical Engineering)*

---

## 👋 Welcome!

If you’re looking for a course that goes **beyond “how to use ML”** and dives into
**why these models work (mathematically)** — you’ve found the right place.

This repository is based on **2102-575: Statistical Inference and Modeling**,
an advanced elective offered by the **Department of Electrical Engineering**,
typically taken in **Year 4, Semester 2**.

> 🧠 (ML) Models are not magic. They are math.
> This course makes sure you understand that math.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

This course assumes you are **comfortable with mathematical tools** commonly used in ML.

### 🔑 You should be familiar with:

* 📐 **Optimization**

  * Convexity
  * Gradient-based methods
  * Duality Theory

* 🧮 **Linear Algebra**

  * Vector spaces
  * Nullity & kernel
  * Dot product
  * Eigenvalues & eigenvectors
  * Inverse Matrix

## 🧠 Course Review

### What makes this course special?

* 🔍 **Deep mathematical insight**

  * Each ML algorithm is studied through its **statistical and mathematical properties**
  * Not just *what it does*, but *why it behaves the way it does*

* 📘 **Theory-first approach**

  * Less emphasis on heavy coding
  * More emphasis on:

    * Assumptions
    * Optimality
    * Bias–variance trade-offs
    * Geometric interpretations

* 🎯 **Perfect as a Free Elective**

  * Especially for students **outside IE curriculum**
  * A strong, reputable course to include on your **transcript**

## 🤝 Recommended Companion Courses

Since this course is **theory-heavy**, pairing it with a **practice-oriented course** is highly recommended:

* 🧠 **2110-574 AI for Engineers**
* 💻 **2104-306 Introduction to Machine Learning (IE)**
* etc...

> These courses focus on **implementation and applications**,
> while **STAT INFER MODEL fills the theoretical gap** perfectly.

## ✨ Final Thoughts

This course teaches you to see machine learning as
**a structured statistical modeling problem**, not a black box.

If you finish this course and still feel confused —
that’s normal. It means you’re learning real things.

> 📐 *When models fail, math tells you why.*

Good luck, and enjoy the depth 🚀📊
