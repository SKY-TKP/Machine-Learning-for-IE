## 🧠 Recommended Problems (Exam-Oriented)

Not sure **which problems are actually worth your time**, especially before exams?

I curated a **chapter-by-chapter list of recommended problems** designed to:
- maximize **exam readiness**
- cover **core concepts efficiently**
- avoid spending time on low-impact exercises

👉 **[Recommended Problems by Chapter (Must-Do List)](https://github.com/SKY-TKP/Machine-Learning-for-IE/blob/main/2100-xxx:%20PROB%20&%20STAT%20ENG/Detailed%20Solution/Recommend%20Problem.md)**

> 💡 Tip:  
> If you are short on time, **start here first**, then move on to additional exercises if time permits.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should be comfortable with the following basics:

* **Calculus I & II:**  
  Differentiation and integration (polynomials & exponential functions).
* **Algebra:**  
  Solving basic equations.
* **Calculator Skills:**  
  Proficiency with your scientific calculator is a must.

No need to be a math wizard — just be comfortable with the fundamentals.

## 🎯 Problem Design & Difficulty Levels

Engineering statistics should **support decision-making**, not just symbolic math.

The problems in this repository are:
- **domain-neutral**
- applicable to **Industrial, Electrical, Chemical, Civil Engineering**, and more

Each chapter categorizes problems into **four difficulty levels**:

1. 🟢 **Basic** — Fundamental definitions and formulas  
2. 🟡 **Intermediate** — Standard exam-level, multi-step problems  
3. 🔴 **Challenge** — Conceptually tricky, logic-heavy problems  
4. ⚙️ **Applications** — Real-world engineering scenarios

## 🧭 Chapter-by-Chapter Quick Review

Below is a **1-paragraph snapshot** of each chapter — perfect for **pre-exam scanning** ✨

### 📌 Chapter 1 — Descriptive Statistics
Learn how to summarize data using mean, median, variance, and visual tools like histograms and boxplots. This chapter builds intuition about *center, spread, and outliers*, which is the foundation of all statistical thinking in engineering.

### 📌 Chapter 2 — Probability Distributions & Theorems
Introduces probability axioms, counting rules, conditional probability, and Bayes’ theorem. You’ll learn how engineers quantify uncertainty and reason about events logically.

### 📌 Chapter 3 — Discrete Random Variables
Focuses on discrete models such as Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and Geometric distributions. Emphasis is placed on expectation, variance, and real-world interpretations.

### 📌 Chapter 4 — Continuous Random Variables
Covers PDFs, CDFs, and major continuous distributions like Uniform, Exponential, and Normal. This chapter connects probability theory with integration and physical measurements.

### 📌 Chapter 5 — Joint Probability Distributions
Explores relationships between multiple random variables, including marginal and conditional distributions, covariance, and independence — essential for multi-factor engineering systems.

### 📌 Chapter 6 — Transformations & Order Statistics
Teaches how distributions change under transformations and how extrema (min/max) behave. Widely used in reliability analysis and system modeling.

### 📌 Chapter 7 — Sampling Distributions & CLT
Introduces the Central Limit Theorem and sampling distributions. Explains *why* Normal approximations work so well in engineering practice.

### 📌 Chapter 8 — Point Estimation
Focuses on estimating unknown parameters using sample data. Concepts such as bias, variance, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) help evaluate estimator quality.

### 📌 Chapter 9 — Interval Estimation
Builds confidence intervals for means and variances. This chapter answers the question: *How confident are we about our estimates?*

### 📌 Chapter 10 — Hypothesis Testing (One Sample)
Introduces formal decision-making using hypothesis tests, p-values, and significance levels. A core skill for engineering judgment.

### 📌 Chapter 11 — Two-Sample Inference
Compares two populations using t-tests and confidence intervals. Commonly applied in process improvement and experimental studies.

### 📌 Chapter 12 — Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Extends hypothesis testing to multiple groups. ANOVA helps identify whether observed differences are real or just random noise.

### 📌 Chapter 13 — Chi-Square Tests
Covers goodness-of-fit and independence tests for categorical data. Useful for quality control and classification problems.

### 📌 Chapter 14 — Non-Parametric Methods
Introduces distribution-free tests when Normal assumptions fail. Robust tools for real-world messy data.

### 📌 Chapter 15 — Simple Linear Regression
Models relationships between two variables. Focuses on interpretation, residual analysis, and practical meaning — not just formulas.

### 📌 Chapter 16 — Multiple Linear Regression
Extends regression to multiple predictors. Discusses multicollinearity, model interpretation, and engineering insights.

### 📌 Chapter 17 — Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT)
A unifying framework for hypothesis testing using likelihoods. Connects estimation and inference at a deeper theoretical level.

## ✨ Final Words

If this repository helps you understand even **one concept faster**  
or saves you **one hour before exams**, then it has done its job.

Feel free to **fork**, **star ⭐**, or share with friends who are  
*currently fighting statistics*.

> 📈 **May your distributions be Normal and your p-values small.**

Good luck & have fun learning! 🚀
