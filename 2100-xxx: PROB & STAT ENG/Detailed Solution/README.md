## 📌 Additional Recommendation

> **If time permits**, it is strongly recommended to attempt **Chapter 18**,
> especially problems in the form of:
>
> * **Cloze Tests**
> * **True / False (T/F) questions**

These problems are excellent for reinforcing **conceptual understanding** and catching **common misconceptions** before the exam.
